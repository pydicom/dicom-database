class CreateViaChunksSignaler(pyinotify.ProcessEvent):
    """
    A class which will signal the in_create event after a specific set of
    events has occurred for a file.  A file transfer agent may write partial
    chunks of a file to disk, and then move/rename that partial file to the
    final filename once all chunks are written. For this use, we cannot watch
    only the IN_CREATE event.  Observe the following event history:

    IN CREATE: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN OPEN: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN MODIFY: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN MODIFY: /path/to/file/filename.part
    ...
    IN MODIFY: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN CLOSE WRITE: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN MOVED FROM: /path/to/file/filename.part
    IN MOVED TO: /path/to/file/filename

    Since we only want to signal when a new file is created, not just when
    a file is moved/renamed, we will use a state-machine to watch the stream
    of events, and only signal when the proper flow has been observed.
    Watching only the IN_MOVED_TO event would be insufficient because that
    could be triggered by someone manually renaming a file in the directory.

    To accomplish what we want, we will watch the IN_CREATE, IN_MOVED_FROM,
    and IN_MOVED_TO events. In the special case of moving a file when both the
    source and destination directories are being watched, the IN_MOVED_TO event
    will also have a src_pathname attribute to tell what the original filename
    was. Since we are only concerned with files created and moved within our
    watched directories, this allows us to track the state from the creation
    of the temporary .part file all the way through moving it to the final
    filename.
